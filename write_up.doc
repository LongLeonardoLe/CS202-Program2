I have the class node contains an array of reviews of a specific vehicle. A node has functions to go to the next node, connect to another node. Also, it can calculate the average rating for this vehicle since the rating is saved as float.
The class history has a head of a linear linked list of nodes. When the user add a new rating for vehicles, the rating will be saved into the history object. When an array of a node in history is full, it will create a new node and add this node to the linked list at the beginning of the list automatically. Also, it can calculate the average rating all the time.
The class vehicle is an abstract base class. It has its passenger history, fee, and status. The fee depends on which types of vehicle to be set. The status depends on which time in the day that the user wants to travel. If it is on the rush hour (5pm to 8pm) then the status will be false, it means that there is a chance for the vehicle to be delayed. The class has the pure virtual functions are getFare() and rate() which only make sense when applied to a specific kind of vehicle. The class also has virtual functions display().
3 derived class are uber, maxTrans, and bus.
The class uber has one more information which is the distance the user travelled. Its fee is the fee for every 100 meters and the distance is also in meter.
The MAX train is $2.5 in default.
The streecar class depends on if the user is a PSU student or not. If yes, then the fee is zero, otherwise, $2.5.
Another kind of node is the node for popularity. It has the same purpose as normal node but contains the type of vehicle, time interval, and the popularity at that time interval.
The class populartiy has an array of head pointers to linked list of popularity of each kind of vehicles. The popularity must be generated by the user, which is inside the function generate(). 
In the main function, after creating the popularity for vehicles, the user will be asked which type of vehicles that he/she wants to use. The user will also be asked to input previous reviews for this kind of vehicle if he wants to. Then the program will display the information about fee, if it is going to be delayed or not.
